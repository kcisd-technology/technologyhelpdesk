This a just a little program I'm working on to help my co-workers and I keep track of different 
types of information.  It is no where near finished, but if you would like to play with it, add 
to it or take away from it, by all means fork it.  Once you create a database.yml file, run the 
migrations and it will create a user named root with a password of blah.  Have fun and please
share.
